# deno-nets
Create, train and use neural networks using Typescript in Deno

Goal: create a Deno module with an interface like Scikit-learn to create, train and use neural networks

Plan: work on this during the upcoming [Deno Hacktoberfest](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/5363-nest-land-hacktoberfest-online-meetup-with-ryan-dahl-sam-williams-and-michael-spengler)

## MVP
- [ ] Dense Layers
- [ ] SGD optimizer
- [ ] Basic metrics (e.g. RMSE for regression, accuracy for classification)
- [ ] A network that achieves decent test accuracy on [MNIST handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Potential Features
- [ ] Convolutional Layers
- [ ] Different optimizers (e.g. AdaGrad, Adam, SGD with momentum, etc.)
- [ ] Advanced metrics (e.g. F1 score)
